# Jarvis! Currently it can listen to your questions and answer it

# It's an Android app.

# Technical Details:
# Uses android native speech recognizer to listen to your voice input and convert it to text.
# The question is sent to Wolfram alpha. The answer is parsed and the app uses the native Text to Speech engine to speak out the answer.


# Future Plan: 
# Add on many more features apart from just question answering, currently I am intended to adding house control features and then may be more.

# Note: 
# The backend can be potentially moved to google instead of Wolfram alpha. Howeever, if you plan to use Wolfram alpha please use your own API key.

# Side note: 
# just at the time of commit i realized that 'Jarvis' is the correct spelling, you might encounter 'Jarwis' in code at some places. Will fix typo sometime later :P
